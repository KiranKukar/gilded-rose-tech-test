# guilded-rose-tech-test
===========================

I first added the legacy code for the test to a file.
Set up rspec, simplecov and rubo cop - for code quality.

Before refacoring the update_quality method in the GildedRose class I set up tests to cover all the current requirments that are being met.
This way I can ensure that when refactoring they all continue to be met.

I've refactored the update_quality method in the GildedRose class with all tests still passing so now it is ready to add the new requirments.
